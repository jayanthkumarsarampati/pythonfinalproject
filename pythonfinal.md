# Stock Analysis Project

Welcome to the Stock Analysis Project! This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of historical stock data, including visualization, machine learning predictions, and correlation analysis.

## Overview

This project is organized into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of stock data analysis. From exploring historical trends to predicting future stock prices, this project covers a wide range of functionalities. The project uses Python and various libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Plotly, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and yfinance.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval and Preprocessing:** User-friendly input prompts for stock ticker symbols and date ranges. Downloads historical stock data using the yfinance library.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizes stock data using candlestick charts, handles missing values, and provides a summary of the dataset.

- **Financial Metrics Calculation:** Calculates key financial metrics such as mean return and risk.

- **Stock Price Prediction:** Utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to predict stock prices and evaluates the model's performance.

- **Binary Classification (Up/Down Prediction):** Extends analysis to binary classification, predicting whether the closing price will go up or down.

- **Residuals and Rolling Average Visualization:** Visualizes residuals and plots rolling averages of stock prices.

- **Future Stock Price Prediction:** Predicts the stock's closing price for the next day based on the last five days' data.

- **Extreme Price Analysis:** Analyzes extreme stock prices, identifying dates with the highest and lowest closing prices. Predicts closing prices for the same date next year.

- **Correlation Matrix:** Analyzes correlation between multiple stock tickers, calculating daily returns and plotting a correlation matrix.

## Getting Started
